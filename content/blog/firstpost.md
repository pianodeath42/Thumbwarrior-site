Hello Thumbwarriors!

Welcome to the very first post on the official Thumbwarrior dev blog! We're incredibly excited to share more about the game, our development process, and the journey of bringing this one-thumb strategic card battler to life.

## What is Thumbwarrior?
(You can put a brief recap here or link to your About page)

## What to Expect from this Blog
Here, we'll be posting:
* Updates on development progress.
* Deep dives into game mechanics and design choices.
* Behind-the-scenes looks at art and sound creation.
* Community highlights and much more!

We're pouring a lot of passion into making Thumbwarrior a unique and engaging experience, especially for those who love strategy but need it in a mobile-friendly, one-handed package.

Stay tuned for more updates!
