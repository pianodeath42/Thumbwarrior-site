# Privacy Policy for Thumbwarrior

**Last Updated:** June 6, 2025

Welcome to Thumbwarrior! This Privacy Policy explains how Robert Monroe ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you download, access, or play our mobile game Thumbwarrior (the "Game") and use our related website (the "Site").

**Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Game or Site, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.**

## 1. Information We Collect

We aim to collect as little personal information as possible to provide you with a great gaming experience.

* **Information You Provide Directly:**
    * We currently do **not** require account creation to play Thumbwarrior.
    * If you contact us directly (e.g., for customer support via email), we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.

* **Information Collected Automatically (Game Data):**
    * **Gameplay Data:** We may collect anonymous or aggregated data related to your gameplay, such as game progress, scores, achievements, in-game purchases (for the full game unlock), and interactions with game features. This data is used to improve the Game and balance gameplay. It is not tied to your personal identity unless explicitly stated (e.g., leaderboards, if implemented).
    * **Device Information (Limited & Anonymous):** We may collect limited, non-personally identifiable information about your device, such as device type, operating system version, and country. This is used for bug fixing, compatibility, and understanding our player base demographics. We do **not** collect unique device identifiers like UDID or Advertising ID without your explicit consent where required by law.
    * **Crash Reports:** If the Game crashes, we may receive anonymous crash reports that include device information and information about the state of the Game at the time of the crash to help us identify and fix bugs.

* **Information from Third-Party Services (If Applicable):**
    * **App Stores:** When you download Thumbwarrior or make an in-app purchase (for the full game unlock) through an app store (e.g., Apple App Store), the app store may collect information from you, subject to their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third-party app stores.
    * **Analytics:** We do **not** currently use any third-party analytics services that collect personal data. If this changes, we will update this policy.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:

* Provide, operate, and maintain the Game and Site;
* Improve, personalize, and expand the Game and Site;
* Understand and analyze how you use the Game and Site;
* Develop new products, services, features, and functionality;
* Process your transactions (e.g., the one-time purchase for the full game);
* Communicate with you for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Game;
* Detect and prevent fraud and ensure the security of our Game and Site;
* Comply with legal obligations.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share the information we collect in the following circumstances:

* **With Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing (for the full game unlock via the App Store) or customer support. These service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information.
* **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Game, protect the personal safety of users of the Game or the public, or protect against legal liability.
* **Aggregated or De-Identified Data:** We may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for various purposes, including research, analysis, and improving the Game.
* **Business Transfers:** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 4. Data Retention

We will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Anonymous or aggregated gameplay data may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.

## 5. Your Data Protection Rights

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, such as accessing or deleting your data, please contact us at `thumbwarrior9@gmail.com`.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Thumbwarrior is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at `thumbwarrior9@gmail.com`, and we will take steps to delete such information from our systems.

## 7. Security of Your Information

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your information. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, or country where the data protection laws may differ from your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
