  {# This assumes your blog posts are in the "posts" collection (default for eleventy-base-blog) #}
  {# and you have an _includes/postslist.njk partial to render them. #}
  {% set postslist = collections.posts | reverse %} {# Get all posts, reverse to show newest first #}
  
  <div class="posts-list-container">
    {% include "postslist.njk" %} {# This partial will loop through `postslist` #}
  </div>

  {# You might want to add pagination here later if you have many posts #}
  {# The eleventy-base-blog starter often includes pagination setup you can adapt #}
